The following codes can be used to replicate the tables and charts in the project "Forecasting Age-Specific Survival Functions with Application to Annuity Pricing":

1. Run AUS_SF_code.R to generate the survival function data.
2. Use Annuity_calc_code.R to replicate the annuity calculation.
3. Reproduce all the charts in the article using Plots.R.

The two data text files represent male and female life tables from the Australian population respectively.
